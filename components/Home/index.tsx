          I&apos;ve always had a passion for creating and designing things from
          scratch or merging some things to make a brand new thing out of them.
          I started my journey as a graphic designer where I made a bunch of
          logos. Then I started designing websites and quickly became passionate
          about programming. That&apos;s when I joined RBK to start an intensive
          training of1200 hours of coding in more than 40 sprints shaping my
          soft and technical skills and discovering cutting-edge technologies.
